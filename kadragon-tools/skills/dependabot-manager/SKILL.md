# Dependabot Manager

Manage dependabot PRs across all repos owned by the authenticated GitHub user in three phases: **Discovery → Triage → Action**.

Phases 1–2 operate entirely via `gh` CLI (no clone). Phase 3 actions may require local clone for config edits and consolidation.

## Phase 1: Discovery

```bash
gh search prs --author app/dependabot --state open --owner @me --json repository,number,title,url --limit 200
```

Group by repo, present count summary. If none found, exit early.

## Phase 2: Triage

Use the bundled script to triage all PRs in one pass — no per-repo agents needed:

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/dependabot-manager/scripts/triage.sh \
  "owner/repo1:123" "owner/repo2:456" ...
```

The script returns a JSON array with `category` for each PR:

| Emoji | Category | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ | `ready` | CI passed + `mergeStateStatus: CLEAN` |
| 🔄 | `needs_rebase` | `CONFLICTING` or `BEHIND` |
| ❌ | `ci_failed` | Any check `FAILURE` |
| ⏳ | `ci_pending` | Checks still running |
| ⚪ | `no_ci` | No status checks configured |

Also audit dependabot config per repo (one `gh api` call each) — check for `groups:` block and `github-actions` ecosystem. See **`references/triage.md`** for details.

Present categorized results per repo with emoji prefix.

## Phase 3: Action

Present all applicable actions at once after triage — don't offer them serially one-by-one. See **`references/actions.md`** for each action's procedure.

| Priority | Action | When |
|----------|--------|------|
| 1 | Batch merge ready PRs | CI passed + mergeable |
| 2 | Handle major PRs | Major version bumps detected |
| 3 | Rebase stale PRs | CI passed but conflicting/behind |
| 4 | Analyze CI failures → fix pipeline | Any check failed |
| 5 | Warn about no-CI PRs | No status checks configured |
| 6 | Configure grouped updates | Missing or partial config |
| 7 | Consolidate ungrouped PRs | 3+ individual PRs, no groups |

## Autonomy Rules

**One confirmation per action class, then chain autonomously.** Once the user approves an action, complete the full pipeline without re-asking at each step.

Pause and confirm only:
- First merge of a session (e.g., "merge these N ready PRs?")
- First PR creation (e.g., "create fix PRs for these N repos?")
- Unexpected CI failure in a PR that was previously passing
- Dependabot replaced a PR with a new one (report the new PR number/scope and confirm merge)

Never pause for:
- Polling CI status
- Triggering `@dependabot rebase` after merging a CI infra fix
- Merging a PR that CI just passed as part of an already-approved pipeline

## Known Gotchas

- **Rebase is not automatic**: After merging a CI infra fix (e.g., Node.js version bump), Dependabot does NOT automatically rebase blocked PRs — always send `@dependabot rebase` explicitly.
- **Dependabot may replace PRs**: After a rebase, check `--author app/dependabot --state open` rather than querying original PR numbers — Dependabot sometimes closes a stale PR and creates a new one with different number and updated scope.

## Subagent Model Selection

Spawn subagents only for tasks that require reading and reasoning (CI log analysis, multi-step git workflows). Scripts handle the rest.

| Task | Model |
|------|-------|
| CI failure log analysis | `sonnet` |
| Config fix PR creation (clone + edit + push) | `sonnet` |
| PR consolidation / major bump handling | `sonnet` |

## Scripts

```
scripts/triage.sh           — batch triage; replaces per-repo triage agents
scripts/poll-ci.sh          — poll until all PRs reach terminal CI state
scripts/consolidate-deps.cjs — consolidate npm/Node.js dependabot PRs
scripts/consolidate-deps.py  — consolidate Python dependabot PRs
```

Invoke via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/dependabot-manager/scripts/<name>`.

## Interaction

- Respond in the user's language; keep technical artifacts (commits, PRs, branches) in English.
- Errors: unauthenticated → suggest `gh auth login`; rate-limited → reduce scope; permission denied → report which repos.
