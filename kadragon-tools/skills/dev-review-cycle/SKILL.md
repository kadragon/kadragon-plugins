# Dev Review Cycle

Post-development workflow that creates a PR, collects reviews from multiple sources, consolidates feedback, and applies improvements — all in one continuous flow.

## Arguments

- `--no-hub` — Skip all GitHub operations: no push, no PR creation, no CI wait, no merge. The workflow commits locally and collects reviews based on the local diff against the base branch. Useful when you want code review feedback without publishing to GitHub.

## Prerequisites

- Initial development must be complete with all changes ready to commit.
- When using `--no-hub`, `gh` CLI authentication is not required.

## Setup: Pre-flight Checks and Repository Metadata

Run the bundled preflight script to detect available tools and repository metadata in one step. The script outputs JSON with all values needed throughout the workflow.

```bash
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/dev-review-cycle/scripts/preflight.sh [--no-hub]
```

The script detects: `gh` auth status, Gemini CLI, Codex (plugin or CLI mode), current branch, base branch, owner/repo, and merge strategy. In `--no-hub` mode it skips all remote/GitHub checks and detects the base branch purely from local state.

If `has_errors` is `true` in the output, stop the workflow and report the errors to the user.

Use the returned JSON values (`no_hub`, `feature_branch`, `base_branch`, `owner_repo`, `gemini_available`, `codex_available`, `codex_mode`, `codex_companion_path`, `merge_strategy`) in all subsequent steps instead of hardcoding. Prefer squash > merge > rebase for merge strategy, in that order of availability.

## CRITICAL: Execution Model

This workflow MUST execute as a single continuous flow. Transitions between steps are automatic — **except Step 3**, where user confirmation is required before applying changes.

After Step 5 (or directly after Step 3 if no changes are needed), proceed through CI wait, merge, and local cleanup without pausing.

## Workflow

### Step 0: Ensure Feature Branch

Before creating a PR, check if you are on the base branch (e.g., `main`). If so, create a new feature branch automatically — do NOT ask the user for a branch name.

Generate the branch name autonomously based on the staged/unstaged changes:

1. Inspect `git diff` and `git status` to understand what changed.
2. Derive a short, descriptive branch name (e.g., `feat/add-login-validation`, `fix/null-pointer-handler`, `refactor/cleanup-utils`).
3. Create and switch to the branch immediately:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b <generated-branch-name>
   ```

If already on a non-base branch, skip this step.

### Step 1: Commit (and Create PR unless `--no-hub`)

Before delegating, **determine the commit message and file list yourself**:

- If you have context from recent development or from Step 0's `git diff` read, use it directly.
- Otherwise (cold invocation), run `git diff --stat HEAD` to understand what changed.
- Run `git log --oneline -5` to match the project's commit style.
- Collect the list of changed files: `git diff --name-only HEAD` (for tracked changes) combined with `git ls-files --others --exclude-standard` (for untracked new files). Merge into a single space-separated list.

Write the commit message and the file list, then **replace `${COMMIT_MESSAGE}` and `${FILES_TO_STAGE}` with the actual values** before passing the prompt to the Agent tool. Do NOT ask the subagent to analyze the diff or figure out which files to stage.

Delegate only the mechanical git operations to a **subagent**.

**When `--no-hub` is set:**

```
Agent tool parameters:
  description: "Commit changes locally"
  model: "sonnet"
  prompt: |
    Commit the following files using this exact message:
    Files: ${FILES_TO_STAGE}
    ---
    ${COMMIT_MESSAGE}
    ---
    1. Stage exactly the listed files: `git add ${FILES_TO_STAGE}`
    2. Create the commit with the message above (do NOT rewrite it).
    Report the commit hash when done.
```

Immediately proceed to Step 2 after the subagent returns.

**When `--no-hub` is NOT set:**

```
Agent tool parameters:
  description: "Commit, push, and create PR"
  model: "sonnet"
  prompt: |
    Commit, push, and create a PR using this exact commit message:
    Files: ${FILES_TO_STAGE}
    ---
    ${COMMIT_MESSAGE}
    ---
    1. Stage exactly the listed files: `git add ${FILES_TO_STAGE}`
    2. Create the commit with the message above (do NOT rewrite it).
    3. Push the branch to origin.
    4. Create a pull request using `gh pr create`.
    Report the PR number and URL when done.
```

Extract the PR number and URL from the subagent's result. If the subagent reports failure, stop the workflow and report the error.

**Do NOT pause or ask the user after PR creation.** Extract the PR number and URL from the subagent result and immediately proceed to Step 2.

### Step 2: Collect Reviews

Collect reviews from up to three sources. Launch all available sources in parallel using background tasks.

#### 2-1: Claude Code Review (review-pr)

Launch a subagent via the Agent tool that runs the `pr-review-toolkit:review-pr` skill on the changed files.

```
Agent tool parameters:
  description: "Comprehensive PR review against ${BASE_BRANCH}"
  model: "sonnet"
  prompt: |
    Run a comprehensive PR review using the /pr-review-toolkit:review-pr skill on the changes
    introduced by branch ${FEATURE_BRANCH} against ${BASE_BRANCH}.
    1. Run `git diff ${BASE_BRANCH}...HEAD --name-only` to identify all changed files.
    2. Invoke the Skill tool with skill="pr-review-toolkit:review-pr" to run all applicable
       review agents (code, errors, tests, comments, types, simplify) on the diff.
    3. Return the full aggregated review summary including Critical Issues, Important Issues,
       Suggestions, and Strengths.
  run_in_background: true
```

#### 2-2: Gemini CLI Review

Skip if `gemini_available` is false from pre-flight. Launch in background:

```bash
# run_in_background: true, timeout: 600000
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/dev-review-cycle/scripts/gemini-review.sh ${BASE_BRANCH}
```

If the command fails, proceed without this review.

#### 2-3: Codex Review

Skip if `codex_available` is false from pre-flight. Launch in background:

```bash
# run_in_background: true, timeout: 600000
bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/dev-review-cycle/scripts/codex-review.sh ${CODEX_MODE} ${BASE_BRANCH} ${CODEX_COMPANION_PATH}
```

If the command fails, proceed without this review.

#### Collecting Results

Launch all available sources in parallel. Allow up to 10 minutes (600000ms) per source. After all reviews are collected, immediately proceed to Step 3.

### Step 3: Consolidate Reviews and Get User Approval

Deduplicate, resolve conflicts, classify scope (in/out), and present a consolidated table to the user. Follow the detailed procedure in **`references/consolidation-guide.md`**.

**STOP here and ask the user for confirmation.** Proceed to Step 4 only after user approval.

After confirmation, record any out-of-scope items in `tasks.md` per the format in `references/consolidation-guide.md`.

If no actionable in-scope suggestions exist, report that reviews found no in-scope issues and skip directly to Step 6.

### Step 4: Apply Improvements

Apply accepted improvements to the codebase. Run tests after changes to verify nothing is broken.

If tests fail after applying improvements, revert the broken change (`git checkout -- <files>`), report which suggestion caused the failure, and ask the user whether to skip it or attempt a different approach. Do not proceed to Step 5 with failing tests.

After improvements are applied and tests pass, immediately proceed to Step 5.

### Step 5: Commit (and Push unless `--no-hub`)

**Determine the commit message and file list yourself** based on which improvements you just applied — you have full context from Step 4. You already know which files you edited. Write a concise commit message and compile the exact file list. **Replace `${COMMIT_MESSAGE}` and `${FILES_TO_STAGE}` with the actual values** before passing the prompt to the Agent tool. Do NOT ask the subagent to re-analyze the diff or discover modified files.

Delegate only the mechanical git operations to a **subagent**.

**When `--no-hub` is set:**

```
Agent tool parameters:
  description: "Commit review improvements locally"
  model: "sonnet"
  prompt: |
    Commit the following files locally (do NOT push) using this exact message:
    Files: ${FILES_TO_STAGE}
    ---
    ${COMMIT_MESSAGE}
    ---
    1. Stage exactly the listed files: `git add ${FILES_TO_STAGE}`
    2. Create the commit with the message above (do NOT rewrite it).
    Do NOT push. Report the commit hash when done.
```

After the subagent returns, skip Step 6 entirely. Report the review summary and applied improvements to the user. The workflow ends here.

**When `--no-hub` is NOT set:**

```
Agent tool parameters:
  description: "Commit and push review improvements"
  model: "sonnet"
  prompt: |
    Commit and push the following files using this exact message:
    Files: ${FILES_TO_STAGE}
    ---
    ${COMMIT_MESSAGE}
    ---
    1. Stage exactly the listed files: `git add ${FILES_TO_STAGE}`
    2. Create the commit with the message above (do NOT rewrite it).
    3. Push to origin (same branch). Do NOT create a new PR.
    Report the commit hash when done.
```

After the subagent returns, immediately proceed to Step 6.

### Step 6: Wait for CI and Merge (skip when `--no-hub`)

Follow the detailed procedure in **`references/ci-failure-handling.md`** for CI wait, failure triage, and merge/cleanup.

Summary:

1. **Wait for CI** — `gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER> --watch --fail-fast` (timeout 15 min).
2. **On failure** — Fetch logs via `scripts/ci-failure-logs.sh`, classify fix (trivial → apply directly; logic change → re-run Steps 2-3). Hard stop after 3 consecutive failures.
3. **Merge and clean up** — Run the merge script with all 4 required positional args (5th is optional):
   ```
   bash ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/dev-review-cycle/scripts/merge-and-cleanup.sh \
     <PR_NUMBER> <BASE_BRANCH> <FEATURE_BRANCH> '<MERGE_STRATEGY_JSON>' [worktree_path]
   ```
   All values come from pre-flight output: `pr_number`, `base_branch`, `feature_branch`, `merge_strategy` (JSON object, not a bare word like "squash"). Report errors if `merge_ok` is false.

## Re-running the Cycle

To run a subsequent review cycle on the same PR (e.g., after applying changes and wanting fresh reviews):

1. Skip Step 1 — the PR already exists.
2. Push the latest changes to the PR branch.
3. Start from Step 2 with the existing PR number.
4. Continue through Steps 3–6 as normal.

When `--no-hub` is set, re-running simply means committing new changes locally and collecting fresh reviews from Step 2 onward.

## Error Handling

| Failure | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Pre-flight `has_errors: true` | Stop. Report errors (e.g., suggest `gh auth login`). |
| Step 1 (commit/PR) fails | Stop. Report the error. |
| Gemini/Codex unavailable or fails | Inform user, proceed with available reviews. |
| No actionable suggestions | Report no issues. Skip Steps 4-5, proceed to Step 6. |
| Push fails (Step 5) | Report error. Suggest manual resolution. |
| CI fails 3 times | Stop. Ask user for guidance. |
| CI fix requires logic change | Re-run Steps 2-3 before pushing. |
| Merge/cleanup fails | Report `merge_ok` / warnings. Do not force-delete. |
