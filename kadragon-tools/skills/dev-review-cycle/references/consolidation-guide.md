# Review Consolidation Guide

Detailed procedure for consolidating multi-reviewer feedback (Step 3 of dev-review-cycle).

## Consolidation Procedure

All three reviewers (Claude Code, Gemini, Codex) use the same P0-P3 priority scheme, making deduplication straightforward.

### 1. Deduplicate

Merge identical issues flagged by multiple reviewers into a single entry, listing all sources (e.g., "Claude, Codex").

### 2. Resolve Conflicts

When reviewers disagree, prefer the suggestion aligned with project conventions (CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md). If conventions are silent, prefer the more conservative option and note the disagreement.

### 3. Categorize

Categorize each remaining suggestion: bug fix, performance, readability, style, architecture.

### 4. Discard Convention Conflicts

Remove suggestions that conflict with project conventions.

### 5. Scope Classification

For each remaining suggestion, determine whether it falls within the current PR's scope:

- **In-scope:** Directly related to the files and logic changed in this PR.
- **Out-of-scope:** Valid improvement but touches unrelated code, requires a separate feature branch, or is an architectural concern beyond this PR's purpose.

### 6. Present to User

Present the consolidated list as a table with:
- Priority (P0-P3)
- Title
- Source attribution (Claude / Gemini / Codex)
- Scope column (In / Out)
- Recommendation (apply / skip with reason)

**STOP and ask the user for confirmation.** The user may approve all, reject some, change scope classifications, or request modifications.

## Recording Out-of-Scope Items in tasks.md

After user confirmation, if any suggestions were classified as out-of-scope:

1. Read the existing `tasks.md` in the project root. If it does not exist, create one.
2. Append items under a `## Review Backlog` section. Classify each item using harness tags based on its nature.

### Format When a PR Exists

```markdown
## Review Backlog

### PR #<PR_NUMBER> — <PR title> (<date>)

- [ ] [debt] <suggestion summary> (source: <reviewer>) — <file:line if applicable>
- [ ] [doc] <suggestion summary> (source: <reviewer>) — <file:line if applicable>
```

### Format When `--no-hub` (No PR)

```markdown
## Review Backlog

### <FEATURE_BRANCH> — <commit summary> (<date>)

- [ ] [debt] <suggestion summary> (source: <reviewer>) — <file:line if applicable>
```

### Tag Guide

| Tag | Use for |
|-----|---------|
| `[debt]` | Code quality, refactoring |
| `[doc]` | Documentation gaps |
| `[constraint]` | Missing tests or architectural rules |
| `[harness]` | Tooling or CI improvements |

Each out-of-scope suggestion becomes a `- [ ]` item for tracking in a future cycle. If a `## Review Backlog` section already exists, append the new PR's items — do not overwrite previous entries.
